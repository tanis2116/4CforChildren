## Analysis for 4C for Children

This analysis was requested by **4C for Children**, a nonprofit organization.  

4C for Children is a **Child Care Resource & Referral Agency** that supports everyone who cares for young childrenâ€”ranging from parents to child care providers. The organization's mission is to ensure **high-quality early education and care** for all children.

A questionaire was presented to childcare centers and in-home childcare centers (Family Childcare Centers/FCCs) to assess their ability to fill classes. A secondary purpose is to identify those who might need assistance in understanding or utilizing the "Step Up to Quality" rating system. The results of that questionaire was collected into an excel spreadsheet and this analysis will focus on Centers and attempt to identify the gap to get to "full" for each of classes: Infant, Toddler, Preschool and School Age.
